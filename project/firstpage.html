    Sabeela Aftabodeen, also known as my mom, was born in
    Guyana, South America on September 16, 1972 and moved to New York when she was 4. Currently, she is a senior person in
    an investment bank and oversees policy and regulatory work, and manages a large team globally.
    She graduated from Hofstra University with a major in Speech Pathology and a Masters in Rehab Counseling â€” it is crazy that she now works at Bank of America, one of the biggest banks in the world. She has one older brother and sister who are both Bankers, so she is the youngest of three.
    Her parents were extremely hard workers and had professional jobs in America, unlike many of their friends, but this was mainly because they were educated in Guyana and had key skills to
    hold professional jobs.

        Both my parents and my grandparents are immigrants which makes me first
generation American. They have worked so hard to be where they are right now, especially my
mother. She is my role model and I am so happy to create this website for her.
