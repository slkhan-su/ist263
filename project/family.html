<p>
    My mom met my dad through a mutual friend when she was 19. She is currently 48, and my dad is 50 and they are still quite happy. My parents have operated on the principles of happiness and hard work and they have been together for almost 22 years. 

    My mom had me when she was 28 on February 7, 2000 and my brother, who is 16, on November 3, 2004 when she was 32. My
    mother also has over 50 cousins and so does my dad, so my family is quite huge. After they got married, they moved to a two-family home in Lynbrook, New York on Long Island and then later moved to my current home in Great Neck, New York.

        My parents have had such a happy marriage and I am so grateful that I have such caring and loving parents.
