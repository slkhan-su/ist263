    My mom met my dad through a mutual friend when she was 19. She is currently 48, and my dad is 50 and they are still very happy. My parents have operated on the principles of happiness and hard work and they have been together for almost 22 years. It's always so amazing hearing the story about how they met — it makes me believe in fate and true love. They inspire me and make me believe that love is real everyday. Both of my parents love eachother uncomditionally and they have the most fun-loving relationship I have ever seen. 

    My mother had me when she was 28 on February 7, 2000 and my brother, who is 16, on November 3, 2004 when she was 32. Growing up, my family lived in Lynbrook, New York in a two family home with my grandma (my mom's mom) and it was such a loving childhood home to grow up in. Although my mom was a working mom who worked so hard 5 times a week, she still had time to take me to my tennis matches, take me to dance practices and even on family vacations. It was clear that no matter what her busy schedule was, she would still make my brother and I her priority (along with my dad). 
    My mother also has over 50 cousins and so does my dad, so my family is quite huge. Fun Fact: Every time I go to a family wedding, there are almost 500 guests at the wedding — I always have the best time with my family. After my parents got married, they moved to my childhood home on Long Island and then later moved to my current home in Great Neck, New York in 2010. My mom is such an amazing influence on my life — she is the reason why I am who I am today. She raised me to be a strong independent woman who does not let anyone influence my opinions. I am so greatful to have such a loving and caring family who supports me in all of my endeavors.

        My parents have had such a happy marriage and I am so grateful that I have such caring and loving parents — this year was their 22nd anniversary.
